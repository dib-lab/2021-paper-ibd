## IBD metagenome data acquisition and processing

We searched the NCBI Sequence Read Archive and BioProject databases for shotgun metagenome studies that sequenced fecal samples from humans with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and healthy controls. 
We included studies sequenced on Illumina platforms with paired-end chemistries and with sample libraries that contained greater than one million reads. 
For time series intervention cohorts, we selected the first time point to ensure all metagenomes came from treatment-naive subjects. 

We downloaded metagenomic FASTQ files from the European Nucleotide Archive using the "fastq_ftp" link and concatenated fast files annotated as the same library into single files. 
We also downloaded iHMP samples from idbmdb.org.
We used Trimmomatic (version 0.39) to adapter trim reads using all default Trimmomatic paired-end adapter sequences (`ILLUMINACLIP:{inputs/adapters.fa}:2:0:15`) and lightly quality-trimmed the reads (`MINLEN:31 LEADING:2 TRAILING:2 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:2`) [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu170]. 
We then removed human DNA using BBMap and a masked version of hg19 (CITE). 
Next, we trimmed low-abundance k-mers from sequences with high coverage using khmer's `trim-low-abund.py` [@doi:10.12688/f1000research.6924.1].  

Using these trimmed reads, we generated scaled MinHash signatures for each library using sourmash (k-size 31, scaled 2000, abundance tracking on) [@doi:10.21105/joss.00027]. 
Scaled MinHash sketching produces compressed representations of k-mers in a metagenome while retaining the sequence diversity in a sample [@doi:10.12688/f1000research.19675.1].
This approach creates a consistent set of k-mers across samples by retaining the same k-mers when the same k-mers were observed. 
This enables comparisons between metagenomes.
We refer to scaled MinHash sketches as *signatures*, and to each sub-sampled k-mer in a signature as a *k-mer*. 
At a scaled value of 2000, an average of one k-mer will be detected in each 2000 base pair window, and 99.8% of 10,000 base pair windows will have at least one k-mer representative. 
We selected a k-mer size of 31 because of its species-level specificity [@doi:10.1128/mSystems.00020-16].
We retained all k-mers that were present in multiple samples. 

## Principle Coordinates Analysis

We used jaccard distance and cosine distance implemented in `sourmash compare` to pairwise compare scaled MinHash signatures. 
We then used the `dist()` function in base R to compute distance matrices. 
We used the `cmdscale()` function to perform principle coordinate analysis [@doi:10.2307/2333639]. 
We used ggplot2 and ggMarginal to visualize the principle coordinate analysis [@doi:10.21105/joss.01686]. 
To test for sources of variation in these distance matrices, we performed PERMANOVA using the `adonis` function in the R vegan package [@{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vegan}].
The PERMANOVA was modeled as `~ diagnosis + study accession + library size + number of k-mers`.

## Random forests classifiers

<!-- We built random forests classifiers to predict CD, UC, and non-IBD status using scaled MinHash signatures (k-mer models), marker genes in the shared 41 genomes (marker gene models), signatures from reads that were detected as marker genes (k-mer models of marker genes), and marker genes in the full metagenome (full marker gene models). -->

We built random forests classifiers to predict CD, UC, and non-IBD status using scaled MinHash signatures .
We transformed sourmash signatures into a k-mer (hash) abundance table where each metagenome was a sample, each k-mer was a feature, and abundances were recorded for each k-mer for each sample. 
We normalized abundances by dividing by the total number of k-mers in each scaled MinHash signature. 
We then used a leave-one-study-out validation approach where we trained six models, each of which was trained on five studies and validated on the sixth.
We built each model six times, each time using a different random seed.
To build each model, we first performed vita variable selection on the training set as implemented in the Pomona and ranger packages [@doi:10.1093/bib/bbx124; @doi:10.18637/jss.v077.i01]. 
Vita variable selection reduces the number of variables (e.g. k-mers) to a smaller set of predictive variables through selection of variables with high cross-validated permutation variable importance [@doi:10.1007/s11634-016-0276-4].
It is based on permutation of variable importance, where p-values for variable importance are calculated against a null distribution that is built from variables that are estimated as non-important [@doi:10.1007/s11634-016-0276-4].
This approach retains important variables that are correlated [@doi:10.1007/s11634-016-0276-4; @doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz149], which is desirable in omics-settings where correlated features are often involved in a coordinated biological response, e.g. part of the same operon, pathways, or genome [@doi:10.1126/science.1087447; @doi:10.1093/nar/gkf388]. 
Using this smaller set of k-mers, we then built an optimized random forests model using tuneRanger [@doi:10.1002/widm.1301]. 
We evaluated each validation set using the optimal model, and extracted variable importance measures for each k-mer for subsequent analysis. 
To make variable importance measures comparable across models, we normalized importance to 1 by dividing variable importance by the total number of k-mers in a model and the total number of models.  

<!-- For the marker gene models, we generated marker gene abundances for 14 ribosomal marker genes and 16S rRNA using singleM [@woodcroft2018singlem].
We then followed the same model building procedure as the k-mer models. -->
 
## Anchoring predictive k-mers to genomes

We used sourmash `gather` with parameters `k 31` and `--scaled 2000` to anchor predictive k-mers to known genomes [@doi:10.21105/joss.00027]. 
Sourmash `gather` searches a database of known k-mers for matches with a query (CITE: gather paper).
We used the sourmash GTDB rs202 representatives data base (https://osf.io/w4bcm/download).
To calculate the cumulative variable importance attributable to a single genome, we used an iterative winner-takes-all approach.
The genome with the largest fraction of predictive k-mers won the variable importance for all k-mers contained within its genome.
These k-mers were then removed, and we repeated the process for the genome with the next largest fraction of predictive k-mers. 
To genomes that were predictive in all models, we took the union of predictive genomes from the 36 models.
We filtered this set of genomes to contain only those genomes with a cumulative normalized variable importance greater than 1%.

## R dominating sets

The original spacegraphcats publication defined the dominating set as a set of nodes in the cDBG such that every node is a distance-1 neighbor of a node in the dominating set [@doi:10.1186/s13059-020-02066-4].
However, the algorithms as implemented allow this distance to be flexible and tunable [@doi:10.1186/s13059-020-02066-4].
We refer to the largest distance that any node may be from a member of the dominating set as the *radius*, *R*. 
Increasing the radius increases the average piece size while reducing the total number of pieces in the graph.

## Genome neighborhood queries with spacegraphcats

<!-- To annotate k-mers with functional potential, we first extracted open reading frames (ORFs) from the shared 41 genomes using prokka, and annotated ORFs with EggNog [@seemann2014prokka; @huerta2019eggnog].
When then used spacegraphcats `multifasta_query` to create a k-mer:gene map.
Spacegraphcats retrieves k-mers in the compact de Bruijn graph neighborhood of a query gene, and hashing these k-mers via sourmash generates a hash:gene map [@doi:10.1186/s13059-020-02066-4; @doi:10.21105/joss.00027]. 
Because genomes with shared 31-mers may annotate the same hash, we allowed k-mers to be annotated multiple times. 
This was particularly appropriate for k-mers from highly conserved regions, e.g. 16S ribosomal RNA. -->

To recover sequence variation associated with genomes that were correlated with IBD subtype, we used spacegraphcats `search` to retrieve k-mers in the compact de Bruijn graph neighborhood of each genomes (k = 31, R = 1) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-020-02066-4]. 
We then used spacegraphcats `extract_reads` to retrieve the reads and `extract_contigs` to retrieve unitigs in the compact de Bruijn graph that contained those k-mers, respectively.
<!-- These reads were used to generate marker gene abundances for the 41 shared genomes for the marker gene random forests models. -->

## Construction of the metapangenome graph

After retrieving genome neighborhood sequences from each metagenome, we combined these sequences to build a single metapangenome graph (R = 10, k = 31).
We increased the radius size of the metapangenome graph to produce larger level 1 dominating set pieces and to overcome highly articulated cDBGs resulting from an abundance of sequencing data.
While working with single-species metapangenome graphs from many metagenomes reduced the graph size compared working with complete metapangenome graphs, we performed two preprocessing steps prior to the metapangenome graph generation.
We combined all genome query neighborhood reads and performed digital normalization and then truncated reads at k-mer that was not present in the data set at least 4 times.
These are heuristic steps that we believe are unlikely to remove biologically important sequences.
<!-- @Titus you had commented that you didn't know if it was a good idea to put that statement in a publication...I welcome your second opinions now :) -->

## Annotating the metapangenome graph

TBD on if the PFAM stuff works.

## Calculating abundances metagenome abundances of dominating set nodes in the metapangenome graph

We calculated k-mer abundances for each graph piece in the level 1 dominating set.
<!-- @Titus could you add some more words to how we do this? -->

## Performing dominating set differential abundance analysis

We used Corncob to perform dominating set differential abundance analysis [@doi:10.1214/19-aoas1283]. 
Corncob tests for differential relative abundance in the presence  of variable sequencing depth and excessive zeroes for unobserved observations, conditions which occur in abundances from dominating sets [@doi:10.1214/19-aoas1283]. 
To focus on the most common sequencing variants and to reduce runtimes, we first filtered to dominating set pieces that were present in at least 100 (16.5%) metagenomes; corncob fits a model to each dominating set piece, so it does not require abundance information for all pieces. 
We performed differential abundance testing using the `bbdml()` function using a likelihood ratio test with `formula = ~ study_accession + diagnosis` and `formula_null = ~study_accession`. 
We estimated the number of k-mers in the quality controlled metagenome reads using ntcard and used this as the denominator. 
We performed Bonferroni p value correction and used a significance cut off of 0.05.

## Searching for isolates that contained differentially abundant genomic sequences

## Metapangenome analysis

TBD

<!--**Pangenome signatures** To evaluate the k-mers recovered by pangenome neighborhood queries, we generated sourmash signatures from the unitigs in each query neighborhood. 
We merged signatures from the same query genome, producing 41 pangenome signatures. 
We indexed these signatures to create a sourmash gather database. 
To estimate how query neighborhoods increased the identifiable fraction of predictive k-mers, we ran sourmash `gather` with the pangenome database, as well as the GenBank and human microbiome metagenome databases. 
To estimate how query neighborhoods increased the identifiable fraction of shared predictive k-mers, we ran sourmash `gather` with the pangenome database alone.
We anchored variable importance of the shared predictive k-mers to known genomes using sourmash `gather` results as above. 

**Pangenome assembly** We used diginorm on each spacegraphcats query neighborhood implemented in khmer as `normalize-by-median.py` with parameters `-k 20 -C 20` [@crusoe2015]. 
We then assembled each neighborhood from a single query with `megahit` using default parameters [@li2015megahit], and annotated each assembly using prokka [@seemann2014prokka].
We used CD-HIT to cluster nucleotide sequences within a pangenome at 90% identity and retained the representative sequence [@fu2012cd].
We annotated representative sequences with EggNog [@huerta2019eggnog].
We used Salmon to quantify the number of reads aligned to each representative gene sequence [@patro2017salmon], and BWA to quantify the number of mapped and unmapped reads [@li2013aligning].

To identify potential genes encoding vancomycin resistance, we performed hidden markov model searches against the pangenome. 
We used the `hmmscan` command from HMMER against the Resfam database with a threshold of 200 [@hmmer; @gibson2015improved]. -->
